About Dataset
Tuberculosis (TB) Chest X-ray Database
A team of researchers from Qatar University, Doha, Qatar, and the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh along with their collaborators from Malaysia in collaboration with medical doctors from Hamad Medical Corporation and Bangladesh have created a database of chest X-ray images for Tuberculosis (TB) positive cases along with Normal images. In our current release, there are 700 TB images publicly accessible and 2800 TB images can be downloaded from NIAID TB portal[3] by signing an agreement, and 3500 normal images.

Note: -The research team managed to classify TB and Normal Chest X-ray images with an accuracy of 98.3%. This scholarly work is published in IEEE Access. Please make sure you give credit to us while using the dataset, code, and trained models.

Contribution

This dataset contains CXR images of Normal (3500) and patients with TB (700 TB images in publicly accessible and 2800 TB images can be downloaded from NIAID TB portal[3] by signing an agreement). The TB database is collected from the source:
NLM dataset: National Library of Medicine (NLM) in the U.S. [1] has made two lung X-ray datasets publicly available: the Montgomery and Shenzhen datasets.
Belarus dataset: Belarus Set [2] was collected for a drug resistance study initiated by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Health, Republic of Belarus.
NIAID TB dataset: NIAID TB portal program dataset [3], which contains about 3000 TB positive CXR images from about 3087 cases.
-Note: Due to the data-sharing restriction, we have to direct the potential user to NIAID website where you can get a data-sharing agreement signing option and you can get DICOM images from there easily. Weblink: https://tbportals.niaid.nih.gov/download-data
RSNA CXR dataset: RSNA pneumonia detection challenge dataset [4], which is comprised of about 30,000 chest X-ray images, where 10,000 images are normal and others are abnormal and lung opacity images.
This database has been used in the paper titled “Reliable Tuberculosis Detection using Chest X-ray with Deep Learning, Segmentation and Visualization” published in IEEE Access in 2020.

Objective

Researchers can use this database to produce useful and impactful scholarly work on TB, which can help in tackling this issue.
